Project Description: Hourly Sales Analysis and Profitability Trends

This project analyzes hourly sales data across a week to uncover patterns in consumer purchasing behavior and identify peak profitability periods. The findings reveal that weekdays, particularly during early morning hours between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM, consistently generate the highest revenue. This insight highlights a critical window for optimizing sales strategies.

Additionally, the analysis shows that certain days, such as Wednesday and Friday, exhibit notably higher sales performance compared to other weekdays. These variations underscore the dynamic nature of profitability throughout the week, offering actionable insights for scheduling promotions, staffing, and inventory management.

By leveraging these trends, businesses can strategically align their operations to maximize revenue during high-performing timeframes while also exploring opportunities to improve sales during slower periods.
